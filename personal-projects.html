        <h3>Ecommerce Shopping Portal Application</h3>
        <p>The responsibility of this web application is that the users should be able to add, delete, edit products to/from cart
        and admins should be able to update/add/delete product details.<br> Implemented this using 3 layers namely Web layer, 
        Service layer and Repository layer.<br> Web Layer is the top most layer of web app responsible for processing user inputs and
        returning correct response to user. It is the entry point of the application so it takes care of authentication.<br>
        Service Layer resides below web layer. It acts as transaction boundary.Business logic resides here. It communicates with DAO to perform database operations.<br>
        Repository layer is the lowest layer of web application. It is responsible for communicating with database.
