<h3>Building an FTP Client and Server</h3>
<p>Created a menu at the client with 1 for GET, 2 for PUT and 3 for QUIT. Here, the server listens for commands from the client. The client waits for a GET command from the user and sends to the server over the socket. If the file is found, the server returns the file or else returns "File not found". The file should be saved at the client. PUT command sends file from client to server. QUIT command for the client initiates a connection close. </p>
